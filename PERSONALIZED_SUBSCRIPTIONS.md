# Personalized Live Updates via Following System

## Overview

This implementation creates a **personalized, interest-based live update system** where users only receive real-time notifications from sellers they actively choose to follow. This prevents information overload and ensures users only see relevant product updates from sellers they're genuinely interested in.

## üéØ Key Concept

**Instead of broadcasting to everyone ‚Üí Only notify interested followers**

- ‚ùå **Before**: All users receive live updates from every seller in the marketplace
- ‚úÖ **After**: Users only receive live updates from sellers they follow from profile pages

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Following-Based Subscription Flow

```
1. User visits seller's profile page
2. User clicks "Follow" button on profile
3. User automatically subscribes to that seller's live updates
4. When seller adds/updates products ‚Üí Only followers get notified
5. User unfollows ‚Üí Stops receiving that seller's updates
```

### GraphQL Schema Enhancements

```graphql
# Following-based subscriptions for personalized updates
onFollowedSellerProducts(followerId: ID!): Product
  @aws_subscribe(mutations: ["createProduct", "updateProduct", "deleteProduct"])

onFollowedSellerInventory(followerId: ID!): InventoryUpdate
  @aws_subscribe(mutations: ["updateProductInventory"])

# Following relationship queries
getFollowedSellers(userId: ID!): [User]
isFollowing(followerId: ID!, followingId: ID!): Boolean
getFollowedSellerProducts(userId: ID!, limit: Int, nextToken: String): ProductConnection
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### 1. **Follow Service** (`src/services/followService.ts`)

Manages following relationships and provides clean API for follow/unfollow actions:

```typescript
// Follow a seller to receive their live updates
followSeller(followerId: string, sellerId: string): Promise<boolean>

// Unfollow a seller to stop receiving their live updates  
unfollowSeller(followerId: string, sellerId: string): Promise<boolean>

// Check if user is following a specific seller
checkFollowingStatus(followerId: string, sellerId: string): Promise<boolean>

// Toggle follow status with result feedback
toggleFollowSeller(followerId: string, sellerId: string): Promise<{
  isFollowing: boolean; 
  action: 'followed' | 'unfollowed'
}>
```

### 2. **Enhanced Subscription Service** (`src/services/subscriptionService.ts`)

**NEW: Following-based subscriptions**
```typescript
// Subscribe to updates from followed sellers only
subscribeToFollowedSellersUpdates(userId: string, callbacks: ProductSubscriptionCallbacks): string

// Get list of sellers that user follows
getFollowedSellersList(userId: string): Promise<string[]>

// Check following status
checkIsFollowing(followerId: string, followingId: string): Promise<boolean>
```

**DEPRECATED: Global marketplace subscriptions**
```typescript
// Old: All users get all updates (overwhelming)
subscribeToMarketplaceUpdates(callbacks) // ‚ùå No longer used

// New: Only followed sellers' updates (personalized)  
subscribeToFollowedSellersUpdates(userId, callbacks) // ‚úÖ Used instead
```

### 3. **Follow Button Component** (`src/components/FollowButton.tsx`)

Reusable component for seller profiles with smart state management:

```typescript
interface FollowButtonProps {
  sellerId: string;
  sellerName: string;
  onFollowStatusChange?: (isFollowing: boolean, action: 'followed' | 'unfollowed') => void;
  style?: any;
  compact?: boolean;
}
```

**Features:**
- **Auto-detects current following status** on mount
- **Loading states** during follow/unfollow operations
- **Success notifications** explaining live update benefits
- **Self-protection** (users can't follow themselves)
- **Authentication checks** before allowing follow actions

**Success Messages:**
- **On Follow**: *"You're now following [Seller]. You'll receive live updates when they add new products or update inventory."*
- **On Unfollow**: *"You've unfollowed [Seller]. You'll no longer receive their live updates."*

## üì± User Experience Flow
